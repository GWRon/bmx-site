The system module's primary function is to provide synchronization with the operating system.

This achieved through the [PollSystem](../../brl/brl.system/#function-pollsystem) and [WaitSystem](../../brl/brl.system/#function-waitsystem) commands. However, you don't usually 
have to call these commands yourself as other BlitzMax commands will call them when necessary.

In addition, the system module also provides commands for checking the date and time, for moving
the mouse pointer and for generating simple system requesters.
