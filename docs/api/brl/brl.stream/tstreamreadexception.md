Exception type thrown by streams in the event of read errors



[TStreamReadException](../../../brl/brl.stream/tstreamreadexception) is usually thrown when a stream operation failed to read enough
bytes. For example, if the stream ReadInt method fails to read 4 bytes, it will throw
a [TStreamReadException](../../../brl/brl.stream/tstreamreadexception).
