Exception type thrown by streams in the event of write errors



[TStreamWriteException](../../../brl/brl.stream/tstreamwriteexception) is usually thrown when a stream operation failed to write enough
bytes. For example, if the stream WriteInt method fails to write 4 bytes, it will throw
a [TStreamWriteException](../../../brl/brl.stream/tstreamwriteexception).
