Cipher Block Chaining mode is a simple mode designed to prevent trivial forms of replay and swap attacks on ciphers.
It is given as:
$$$
C_i = E_k(P_i \oplus C_{i - 1})
$$$

It is important that the initialization vector be unique and preferably random for each message encrypted under the same key.


## Methods

### `Method Encrypt:Int(pt:Byte Ptr, ct:Byte Ptr, length:UInt)`

Encrypts the plaintext <b>pt</b> of <b>length</b> to <b>ct</b>.

<b>length</b> must be a multiple of the cipher block size, otherwise you must manually pad the end of your
message (either with zeroes or with whatever your protocol requires).


#### Returns
CRYPT_OK on success.


<br/>

### `Method GetIV:Int(IV:Byte Ptr, length:UInt Var)`

Reads the IV out of the chaining mode, and stores it in <b>IV</b> along with the <b>length</b> of the IV.

<br/>

### `Method SetIV:Int(IV:Byte Ptr, length:UInt)`

Initializes the chaining mode state as if the original IV were the new IV specified.

The <b>length</b> of <b>IV</b> must be the size of the cipher block size.

This method is handy if you wish to change the IV without reâ€“keying the cipher.

The new IV replaces the existing IV as if it were the last ciphertext block.


<br/>

### `Method Done:Int()`

Terminates the cipher stream.
