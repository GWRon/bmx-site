F8 Cipher Mode


A chaining mode for block ciphers.


## Methods

### `Method Start:Int(cipher:TCipher, iv:Byte Ptr, key:Byte Ptr, keylen:Int, saltKey:Byte Ptr, saltkeylen:Int, numRounds:Int)`

Starts the cipher mode state using <b>key</b> as the secret key and <b>iv</b> as the counter.

It uses <b>saltKey</b> as the IV encryption. The salt key can be shorter than the secret key, but not longer.


#### Returns
CRYPT_OK if the cipher initialized correctly, otherwise, returns an error code.


<br/>

### `Method Encrypt:Int(pt:Byte Ptr, ct:Byte Ptr, length:UInt)`

Encrypts the plaintext <b>pt</b> of <b>length</b> to <b>ct</b>.

The <b>length</b> is specified in bytes and does not have to be a multiple of the ciphers block size.


#### Returns
CRYPT_OK on success.


<br/>

### `Method Decrypt:Int(ct:Byte Ptr, pt:Byte Ptr, length:UInt)`

Decrypts the ciphertext <b>ct</b> of <b>length</b> to <b>pt</b>.

The <b>length</b> is specified in bytes and does not have to be a multiple of the ciphers block size.


#### Returns
CRYPT_OK on success.


<br/>

### `Method GetIV:Int(IV:Byte Ptr, length:UInt Var)`

Reads the IV out of the chaining mode, and stores it in <b>IV</b> along with the <b>length</b> of the IV.

This works with the current IV value only and not the encrypted IV value specified during the call to [Start](../../../crypto/crypto.f8mode/tf8ciphermode/#method-startintciphertcipher-ivbyte-ptr-keybyte-ptr-keylenint-saltkeybyte-ptr-saltkeylenint-numroundsint).
The purpose of this method is to be able to seek within a current session only. If you want to change the session IV you will have to call [Done](../../../crypto/crypto.f8mode/tf8ciphermode/#method-doneint) and
then start a new state with [Start](../../../crypto/crypto.f8mode/tf8ciphermode/#method-startintciphertcipher-ivbyte-ptr-keybyte-ptr-keylenint-saltkeybyte-ptr-saltkeylenint-numroundsint).


<br/>

### `Method SetIV:Int(IV:Byte Ptr, length:UInt)`

Initializes the chaining mode state as if the original IV were the new IV specified.

The <b>length</b> of <b>IV</b> must be the size of the cipher block size.

This method is handy if you wish to change the IV without reâ€“keying the cipher.

The IV is encrypted as if it were the prior encrypted pad.


<br/>

### `Method Done:Int()`

Terminates the cipher stream.
