Similar to [Crypto.CBCMode](../crypto/crypto_cbcmode.md), it is a simple mode designed to prevent trivial forms of replay and swap attacks on ciphers.
It is given as:
$$$
\begin{aligned}
C_{-1} &= E_k(C_{-1}) \\
C_i &= P_i \oplus C_{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$$

Like in the [Crypto.CFBMode](../crypto/crypto_cfbmode.md), the output width is the same as the width of the block cipher.
This mode will also buï¬€er the output which will allow you to encrypt or decrypt partial blocks without delay.
